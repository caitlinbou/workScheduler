# workScheduler
This is a simple scheduling tool to schedule out a 9am-5pm workday. I used JQUERY to dynamically create the hour timeslots, with the help of a little CSS to color them according to whether the time has past, is current, or is in the future. This functionality was made possible with MOMENT.JS for comparing the present time to other times. (See resource link below.)
[Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) 

I used Local Storage to ensure that edits to each timeblock would be saved upon browser refresh.

I also used Font Awesome for button styling

The simplicity of this scheduling tool makes it ideal for the basic outline of a busy day, with easy access via a quick pin to the browser.
