# workScheduler
This is a simple scheduling tool to schedule out a 9am-5pm workday. I used JQUERY to dynamically create the hour timeslots and color them differently depending on whether the time has past, is current, or is in the future. This functionality was made possible with MOMENT.JS (See resource link below.)

I used Local Storage to ensure that edits to each timeblock would be saved.
