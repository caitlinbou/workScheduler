# workScheduler
This is a simple scheduling tool to schedule out a 9am-5pm workday. I used JQUERY to dynamically create the hour timeslots, with the help of a little CSS to color them according to whether the time has past, is current, or is in the future. Through localStorage, data is retained upon refresh.

## Technologies Used
[Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) to get current date/time.

[Font Awesome](fontawesome.com) for button styling

The simplicity of this scheduling tool makes it ideal for the basic outline of a busy day, with easy access via a quick pin to the browser.
