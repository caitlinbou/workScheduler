# workScheduler
This is a simple scheduling tool to schedule out a 9am-5pm workday. I used JQUERY to dynamically create the timeslots and color them differently depending on whether the time has past, is current, or is future time. This functionality was made possible with MOMENT.JS (See resource link below.)
